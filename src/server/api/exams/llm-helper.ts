Difficulty levels are defined as follows:
- Easy: Questions that test basic understanding or recall of facts.
- Medium: Questions that require application of concepts or some reasoning.
- Hard: Questions that involve analysis, evaluation, or synthesis of information.



Instructions:
- Analyze the provided context to identify key concepts, facts, or principles related to the topic.
- Create {numberOfQuestions} MCQs that cover a range of subtopics within the context and are not repetitive.
- Each question must be directly supported by the information in the context.
- Ensure that each question is clearly worded, concise, and has only one correct answer.
- Provide four plausible options for each question, including distractors that reflect common misconceptions or errors.
- All options should be consistent in terms of length, complexity, and grammatical structure.
- Specify the correct answer by its index (0 for the first option, 1 for the second, etc.).



Ensure that the 'id' is unique and increments from 1 to {numberOfQuestions}.`
